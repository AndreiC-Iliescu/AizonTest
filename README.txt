Aizon Test ----- V0.2

This is a simple automation project part of the tecnical test for Aizon made by Andrei Iliescu(andreicosminiliescu@gmail.com).

The project uses pytest unittest configuration with the addition argument:
--html=reportTest.html (or you can rename it).

This project involves manual validation for the test results.

Posible updates:
- Make a custom report file to add screenshots.
- Replace hardcoded time.sleep() elements with implicit waits.
- Improve Locator elements, steer away from xpath use.
- Implement API testing.

Note: this is a simple version made within a very tight timeframe.
